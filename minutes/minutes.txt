 - Important to have flexibility when reporting 
 	- Filter based on community partner, zip code, date range
 	- Print # of students and # total hours with each report
 	- Able to download the report to an excel file

 - Community Partners will not be interacting with the system 
 	- Potential future consideration but not a priority for now

 - Helpful for peer leaders to to be able to edit for personal service

 - Client would provide us with an example of the spreadsheet that with community partners

NU ACES:
myneu salesforce backend, limited support
application features
    admin input via form / spreadsheet import
    separate admin / student views
    event check-in
    community location listing
    track civic actions and community engagements
        meeting attendance
        timeline of activity
        hours not emphasized - opt-in program
        students should see break down of their activities
    filtered reports
        data by student and some kind of aggregate data
    event calendar
honor system, mostly

concerns:
security
filter types
information per student to store
information to include in reports
peer leader view

Emails with clients:

Admins should be able to enter data both manually and via excel files.
Data will include students, community partners, civic engagement activities.
Core civic engagement activities are in a pre-defined list, but students should be able to enter their own.
Admins should be able to update a calendar of possible events.
Admins should be able to view and edit activity for all students.
Peer leaders should be able to view activity for their assigned students.
Student volunteers should be able to check in and out of volunteering with a community partner.
Volunteers should be able to view their own activity history (in total and in summarizing statistics e.g. number of hours).
Peer leaders should have all the functionality of a student volunteer in regards to their own activity.
Community partners will not be accessing the system directly.
